# SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Analysis

This repository is designed for analyzing mutations in the nucleotide sequences of various SARS-CoV-2 genes. The analysis identifies mutations by comparing two different nucleotide sequences of the virus, helping researchers focus on genes with minimal mutations for vaccine or drug development.

## 🔬 Genes in the SARS-CoV-2 Genome
The virus genome includes the following genes:

- **ORF1ab** → Encodes proteins ORF1a and ORF1ab.
- **S** → Encodes the Spike protein, responsible for docking with ACE2 receptors in human cells.
- **ORF3a** → Encodes the ORF3a protein.
- **E** → Encodes the Envelope protein.
- **M** → Encodes the Membrane protein.
- **ORF6** → Encodes the ORF6 protein.
- **ORF7a** → Encodes the ORF7a protein.
- **ORF7b** → Encodes the ORF7b protein.
- **ORF8** → Encodes the ORF8 protein.
- **N** → Encodes the Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein.
- **ORF10** → Encodes the ORF10 protein.

## 🚀 Features
- Compare nucleotide sequences from two different sources (e.g., different geographic regions or time periods).
- Identify mutations associated with each gene.
- Output the mutated nucleotide details and generate a mutation comparison image.
